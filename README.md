# IMSGP-experiment
Here, you can find the numerical experiments of our two proposed algorithms (IMSGP1 and IMSGP2) in our paper 
tittled "Inertial based Spectral method for Solving System of Nonlinear Equations with Application''. Each of the proposed algorithm is compared with three existing Algorithms
namely DAIS1, MSGP and SGPM (PROPOSED BY Zhang and Zhou in 2006).
We performed two experimnts (experiment1 and 2). In experiment1, we compared the IMSGP1 algorithm with the DAIS1, MSGP and SGPM algorithms. 
And in Experiment2, we compared the IMSGP2 algorithms with DAIS1, MSGP and SGPM algorithms.
All codes are written on Matlab
R2019b and run on a PC of corei3-4005U processor,
4 GB RAM and 1.70 GHZ CPU.
